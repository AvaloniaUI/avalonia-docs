Welcome to the documentation for Avalonia XPF, our cross-platform fork of WPF. 

## Overview 

Avalonia XPF is a powerful solution that enables WPF applications to run natively across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, with upcoming support for iOS, Android, and WebAssembly. 

Avalonia XPF maintains both API and binary compatibility with WPF while replacing the low-level WPF implementation (MilCore) with Avalonia's cross-platform rendering engine. This approach allows developers to migrate their existing WPF applications to other platforms with minimal code changes, preserving their investment in WPF development and third-party controls.

## Licensing

As a commercial product, Avalonia XPF offers different licensing tiers to suit various needs:

| Platform        |  Indie | Business | Enterprise |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|
| `Windows` | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | 
| `macOS` | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | 
| `Desktop Linux` | ✖ | ✔ | ✔ | 
| `Embedded Linux` | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ | 
| `iOS` | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ | 
| `Android` | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ | 
| `WebAssembly` | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ | 

All applications built with Avalonia XPF will continue to work in perpetuity, regardless of license status. This ensures that your deployed applications remain functional and stable for your end users.

### Indie Licenses
The Indie license is offered as an annual subscription and includes:

* 30-day money-back guarantee 
* Full access to Avalonia XPF features on Windows & macOS

If an Indie license expires, developers will no longer be able to build new versions of their applications using XPF. However, all previously built applications will continue to function normally.

### Business & Enterprise Licenses
Business and Enterprise licenses are perpetual, offering a permanent right to use Avalonia XPF. These licenses include:

* Fully supported 30-day trial period
* Permanent license to build with Avalonia XPF
* 12 months of updates and engineering support

Both Business and Enterprise licenses enable organizations to thoroughly evaluate XPF's capabilities through a supported trial period, ensuring compatibility with their existing applications across their target platforms.

### Trial Availability
Trial periods are exclusively available for Business and Enterprise licenses. These trials are fully supported by our engineering team to ensure organizations can thoroughly evaluate XPF's capabilities with their specific applications and use cases.

For Indie developers, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee instead of a trial period. This approach allows developers to test XPF's compatibility with their projects while ensuring they receive the appropriate level of support for their needs. We ask that Indie developers not apply for Business or Enterprise trials.

## Hybrid XPF
One of Avalonia XPF's unique features is its [hybrid capability](embedding/xpf-in-avalonia.md), allowing Avalonia developers to use WPF controls within applications. This flexibility enables Avalonia developers to leverage over 700 existing WPF controls from major vendors such as [Telerik](https://www.telerik.com/), [Actipro](https://www.actiprosoftware.com/), [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/), [Infragistics](https://www.infragistics.com/), and [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/), bridging the gap between traditional WPF development and modern cross-platform applications.
