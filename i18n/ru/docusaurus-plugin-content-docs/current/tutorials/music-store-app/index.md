# Music Store App

In this tutorial you will create a desktop app based on the idea of a music store.  The app is highly graphical - it presents images of album covers, and uses semi-transparent 'acrylic' blurred window backgrounds to give a very up-to-date look. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able search the iTunes online list of albums, and select albums for your own list.

In this tutorial you will use the MVVM pattern with the _ReactiveUI_ framework to manage multiple application windows. Also you will use advanced asynchronous techniques to implement the album search and other features, so that application responsiveness is maintained.

:::warning
This is a more advanced tutorial. The 'To Do List App' is a recommended prerequisite if you have limited experience with the MVVM pattern. Read about the 'To Do List App' tutorial [here](../todo-list-app/).

This tutorial contains instructions for using the _Rider_ IDE on macOS; however the steps will be similar on other operating systems, and using other IDEs such as Visual Studio on _Microsoft Windows_.
