This section has practical tutorials that are designed to help you learn _Avalonia UI_ and build your confidence. Here is a brief guide to what you can expect from each of the tutorials:

## To Do List App

A simple to do list application using the Model View View-Model (MVVM) pattern, with binding to a collection and _Reactive UI_ programming, from which you will meet:

* `RaiseAndSetIfChanged`
* `ReactiveCommand`
* `IObservable<>`
* `Observable.Merge()` with `Select()`, `Take()`, and `Subscribe()` methods.

This is a very good introduction to the MVVM and _ReactiveUI_ techniques recommended for _Avalonia UI_ programming. Follow the tutorial [here](./todo-list-app/).

## Music Store App

This app was made for a demonstration on a webinar hosted by _JetBrains_, and co-hosted by Dan Walmsley, one of the creators of _Avalonia UI_.

It uses the _JetBrains Rider_ IDE running on macOS, but the steps will be equivalent on other platforms; and the developer experience will also be similar on other IDEs such as Visual Studio.

The app features a highly graphical application using the MVVM pattern, and including how to display a dialog, present images and collections of data, and implement data persistence.
