            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <a href="button">Button</a>
            </td>
            <td>The basic button control - can display text, an icon or both. Has standard 'click' behavior.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <a href="repeatbutton">Repeat Button</a>
            </td>
            <td>A button that raises its click event repeatedly when it is pressed and held.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <a href="radiobutton">Radio Button</a>
            </td>
            <td>A button that has a selected state. It can be placed in a group so that selection of one button deselects all the others in the group.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <a href="togglebutton">Toggle Button</a>
            </td>
            <td>A button that has a selected state and a unselected state. Subsequent clicks 'toggle' this state. A 'checked' pseudo class allows different styles to be allocated to the selected  and unselected states.</td>
