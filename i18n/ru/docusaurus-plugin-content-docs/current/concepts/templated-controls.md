# Templated Controls

`TemplatedControl`s are best used for generic controls that can be shared among various applications. They are _lookless_ controls, meaning that they can be restyled for different themes and applications. The majority of standard controls defined by Avalonia fit into this category.



If you want to provide a `Style` for your `TemplatedControl` in a separate file, remember to include this file in your Application via [`StyleInclude`](../basics/user-interface/styling/styles).
