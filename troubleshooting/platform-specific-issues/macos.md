## App menu shows _About Avalonia_ menu item

This means that your application most likely does not specify a menu. On startup, Avalonia creates the default menu items for an application and automatically adds the _About Avalonia_ item when no menu has been configured. This can be resolved by adding one to your `App.xaml`:

```xml
<Application xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:local="using:RoadCaptain.App.RouteBuilder"
             x:Class="RoadCaptain.App.RouteBuilder.App">
	<NativeMenu.Menu>
		<NativeMenu>
			<NativeMenuItem Header="About MyApp" Click="AboutMenuItem_OnClick" />
		</NativeMenu>
	</NativeMenu.Menu>
</Application>
```

The rest of the macOS default menu items will still be generated by Avalonia.

## Application name in menu bar does not match

When you run an app from a bundle the name for the app that is shown in the menu bar is taken from the `Info.plist` in the bundle instead of the `Name` property in `App.xaml`.

If the names do not match, verify that the values for `CFBundleName`, `CFBundleDisplayName` and the `Name` property are the same.

Note that `CFBundleName` is limited to 15 characters, if your application name is longer you _must_ set `CFBundleDisplayName`.
