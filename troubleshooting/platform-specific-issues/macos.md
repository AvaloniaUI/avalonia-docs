## App menu

#### App menu shows _About Avalonia_ menu item

This means that your application most likely does not specify a menu. On startup, Avalonia creates the default menu items for an application and automatically adds the _About Avalonia_ item when no menu has been configured. This can be resolved by adding one to your `App.xaml`:

```xml
<Application xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:local="using:RoadCaptain.App.RouteBuilder"
             x:Class="RoadCaptain.App.RouteBuilder.App">
	<NativeMenu.Menu>
		<NativeMenu>
			<NativeMenuItem Header="About MyApp" Click="AboutMenuItem_OnClick" />
		</NativeMenu>
	</NativeMenu.Menu>
</Application>
```

The rest of the macOS default menu items will still be generated by Avalonia.

#### Application name in menu bar does not match

When you run an app from a bundle the name for the app that is shown in the menu bar is taken from the `Info.plist` in the bundle instead of the `Name` property in `App.xaml`.

If the names do not match, verify that the values for `CFBundleName`, `CFBundleDisplayName` and the `Name` property are the same.

Note that `CFBundleName` is limited to 15 characters, if your application name is longer you _must_ set `CFBundleDisplayName`.

## Packaging

1. Review Parcel's build logs for error information
2. Check the [Apple Bundle Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/Introduction/Introduction.html) for bundle requirements

## Code signing

### Common Issues

#### "Developer ID Application" not available when creating a certificate

This option requires Apple Developer Account team membership. Contact your team's account holder for access.

#### App signs successfully but cannot execute on other machines

Verify that you used a "Developer ID Application" certificate. "Apple Development" certificates only work for development builds.

### Other code signing issues

For issues not covered here:

1. Review Parcel's signing logs for error information
2. Verify certificate status in Apple Developer portal

## Notarization

### Common Issues

#### Notarization takes too long

Notarization typically takes a few minutes but can take up to an hour during peak times. In worst cases, it can take several hours depending on application size.

#### Invalid credentials" error

- Verify that your Apple ID and app-specific password are correct
- Ensure your Team ID is accurate
- Check your Apple Developer account status

#### "License agreement must be accepted" error

- Log in to [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/) in a web browser
- Check for pending agreements or notifications
- Accept any new license agreements or terms of service
- Wait a few minutes after accepting before retrying
- Common after Apple developer program updates or policy changes

#### Notarization fails during upload

- Check your internet connection

### Other notarization issues

For issues not covered here:

1. Check Apple's [Notarizing macOS Software Before Distribution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution) guide
2. Review notarization logs in Parcel's output
