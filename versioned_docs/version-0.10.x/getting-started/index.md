# Getting Started with Avalonia

Ready to get started with Avalonia? Follow these steps to install the templates and create your first application.

## Installation

To install the Avalonia templates, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new install Avalonia.Templates
```

> Note: For .NET 6.0 and earlier, replace `install` with `--install` instead.

## Creating a New Application

Once the templates are installed, you can create a new Avalonia application by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet new avalonia.app -o MyApp
```

This will create a new folder called `MyApp` with your application files. To run your application, navigate to the `MyApp` directory and run:

```bash
cd MyApp
dotnet run
```
That's it! Your Avalonia application is now up and running. You can open the `MyApp` folder to start improving and building upon your application.
