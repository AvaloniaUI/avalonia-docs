The `ScrollViewer` control scrolls its content if the content is bigger than the space available. A `ScrollViewer` cannot be contained in a control that has infinite height or width (depending on scrolling direction) such as a `StackPanel`. To avoid it, you can either set fixed Height/Width or MaxHeight/MaxWidth or choose another container panel.
