# TreeDataGrid

## Introduction

`TreeDataGrid` is a control for the [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) UI framework which displays hierarchical and tabular data together in a single view. It is a combination of a `TreeView` and `DataGrid` control.

The control has two modes of operation:

* Hierarchical: data is displayed in a tree with optional columns
* Flat: data is displayed in a 2D table, similar to other `DataGrid` controls

An example of `TreeDataGrid` displaying hierarchical data:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img src="/img/controls/treedatagrid/files.png" />
</div>

An example of `TreeDataGrid` displaying flat data:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img src="/img/controls/treedatagrid/countries.png" />
</div>

### Current Status

The control is currently in _early beta_. As such there will be bugs, missing features and lacking docs, but the control should be generally usable and performant.
