## Adding Content to the Dialog

Inside the dialog we would like the user to search for albums, and then select an album to buy.

To do this we will need to query a web api to return a list of items. This will take some time so the user may need to wait.

The UI in order to achieve this can consist of the following elements.

* A `TextBox` for the user to type the album or artist name.
* A `ProgressBar` to tell the user their search request is happening.
* A `ListBox` to display a list of Albums and allow the user to select one.
* A `Button` for the user to confirm their selection. Effectively buying the album.

Controls can be laid out inside `Panels`. The most common ones are `StackPanel` and `DockPanel`.

A `StackPanel` will stack multiple controls on top of each other or next to each other depending on the `Orientation` that is set. The default being `Vertical`.

A `DockPanel` allows controls to be docked to any side the user wished via the `DockPanel.Dock` attached property. The last control inside a `DockPanel` if it doesn't have a `Dock` specified will fill the remaining space.

Right click on your `Views` folder and select `Add` → `Avalonia User Control` to add a new `View` to the project.

Name this `MusicStoreView` and press the `Enter` key when prompted.

Build the project so that the previewer will work.

Declare a `<DockPanel>`.

```xml
<DockPanel>

</DockPanel>
```

Inside the `DockPanel` add a `<StackPanel>`. Set `DockPanel.Dock="Top"` on the `StackPanel` so that it will be positioned at the top.

```xml
<DockPanel>
    <StackPanel DockPanel.Dock="Top">

    </StackPanel>
</DockPanel>
```

Inside the `StackPanel` add a `TextBox` and a `ProgressBar`.

```xml
<DockPanel>
    <StackPanel DockPanel.Dock="Top">
        <TextBox Text="{Binding SearchText}" Watermark="Search for Albums...." />
        <ProgressBar IsIndeterminate="True" IsVisible="{Binding IsBusy}" />
    </StackPanel>
</DockPanel>
```

Set the properties as shown. Notice we have bound the `Text` property of the `TextBox` to a property called `SearchText`. The `View` will expect to find this property on our `MusicStoreViewModel` and will keep that property in sync with whatever the user types. We also added a `binding` for the `IsVisible` to the `IsBusy` property.

To add these `properties` to our `ViewModel` open `MusicStoreViewModel.cs` . Make the class inherit `ViewModelBase`, so that it is capable of notifying changes.

Then add the following code:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI;

namespace Avalonia.MusicStore.ViewModels
{
    public class MusicStoreViewModel : ViewModelBase
    {
        private string? _searchText;

        public string? SearchText
        {
            get => _searchText;
            set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref _searchText, value);
        }
    }
}
```

Here we can see that we have a normal getter which returns the field, and we have a Setter that calls a method.

This calls `RaiseAndSetIfChanged` this method checks to see if `value` is different from the current `_seachText` field and if so, it changes it to the new value, and then raises an event to notify the `View` that it has changed.

Any View that has a `{Binding SearchText}` expression will automatically update, and stay in sync with this property.

Also add a boolean property named `IsBusy` with the same convention.

```csharp
using ReactiveUI;

namespace Avalonia.MusicStore.ViewModels
{
    public class MusicStoreViewModel : ViewModelBase
    {
        private bool _isBusy;
        private string? _searchText;

        public string? SearchText
        {
            get => _searchText;
            set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref _searchText, value);
        }

        public bool IsBusy
        {
            get => _isBusy;
            set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref _isBusy, value);
        }
    }
}
```

Return to the `MusicStoreView.axaml`. So that we can add the remaining controls.

Back inside our DockPanel, add a `Button` and set it to Dock at the bottom. Set its `Content` to "Buy Album" its `HorizontalAlignment` to `Center`.

Then bind its `Command` to `BuyMusicCommand` which we will create in the next chapter.

```xml
<DockPanel>
    <StackPanel DockPanel.Dock="Top">
        <TextBox Text="{Binding SearchText}" Watermark="Search for Albums...." />
        <ProgressBar IsIndeterminate="True" IsVisible="{Binding IsBusy}" />
    </StackPanel>
    <Button Command="{Binding BuyMusicCommand}" Content="Buy Album" DockPanel.Dock="Bottom" HorizontalAlignment="Center" />
</DockPanel>
```

Add a `ListBox` to the `DockPanel`. Since this is the last item in the Panel it will fill the remaining space, and since the `TextBox` and `ProgressBar` are docked to the top inside a `StackPanel` and the `Button` is docked to the bottom. This ListBox will appear in between them and fill the space.

Bind the `Items` and `SelectedItem` properties as shown, set the `Background` to `Transparent`. Add a `Margin` of `0 20`. This means left and right sides have 0 and top and bottom have 20. This creates some space between the other controls.

```xml
<ListBox Items="{Binding SearchResults}" SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedAlbum}" Background="Transparent" Margin="0 20" />
```

As you might imagine, the `Items` property needs some kind of List to bind to and the `SelectedItem` property needs some object to bind to also. However this time they will not be simple types like `bool`, `int` or `string`. They will be `ViewModels`, this is why we created the `AlbumViewModel` earlier.

Return to the `MusicStoreViewModel.cs` file and add the following code.

```csharp
private AlbumViewModel? _selectedAlbum;

public ObservableCollection<AlbumViewModel> SearchResults { get; } = new();

public AlbumViewModel? SelectedAlbum
{
    get => _selectedAlbum;
    set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref _selectedAlbum, value);
}
```

As you can see the `SelectedAlbum` property is implemented with the by now familiar pattern.

The `SearchResults` property does not require this pattern and is a special type, called `ObservableCollection<T>`. This comes from the `using System.Collections.ObjectModel;` namespace.

An observable collection is simply a `List` or `Collection` that when items are added or removed from it, it fires `events` so other code can be notified of changes to the list.

Notice this property is instantiated with `= new ();`. Forget this and it will be `null` and won't work.

Since we are using `ObservableCollection` when we `bind` the `ListBox`s `Items` property to it, then the `ListBox` control will start listening to events and keep the `Items` inside the `ListBox` in sync with the `ObservableCollection` on the `ViewModel`.

The `ListBox` will see that the `SearchResults` has an item inside it, it will check the type of the item, which will be `AlbumViewModel`. The `ListBox` will then see if it has a `DataTemplate` for that type, which we don't. However it will find at the root of the application in `App.axaml`.

In order to do that we will create a special class named `ViewLocator`. Right click on project and `Add`→ `Class/Interface`:

```csharp
using System;
using Avalonia.Controls;
using Avalonia.Controls.Templates;
using Avalonia.MusicStore.ViewModels;

namespace Avalonia.MusicStore
{
    public class ViewLocator : IDataTemplate
    {
        public bool SupportsRecycling => false;

        public IControl Build(object data)
        {
            var name = data.GetType().FullName!.Replace("ViewModel", "View");
            var type = Type.GetType(name);

            if (type != null)
            {
                return (Control) Activator.CreateInstance(type)!;
            }
            else
            {
                return new TextBlock {Text = "Not Found: " + name};
            }
        }

        public bool Match(object data)
        {
            return data is ViewModelBase;
        }
    }
}
```

And then add that to `App.axaml`:

 ```xml
<Application.DataTemplates>
    <local:ViewLocator />
</Application.DataTemplates>
```

This ViewLocator is a special `DataTemplate` that will take the typename, in this case `Avalonia.MusicStore.ViewModels.AlbumViewModel` and check to see if a `View` exists at `Avalonia.MusicStore.Views.AlbumView`.

If the ListBox finds one, it will display whatever `xaml` that `View` describes inside the `ListBox`, otherwise it will just show the typename inside the `ListBox` as a string.

Lets test this by adding a contructor on the `MusicStoreViewModel.cs`.

```csharp
public MusicStoreViewModel()
{
    SearchResults.Add(new AlbumViewModel());
    SearchResults.Add(new AlbumViewModel());
    SearchResults.Add(new AlbumViewModel());
}
```

Before we can run this we need to add our `MusicStoreView` to our `MusicStoreWindow` which is currently empty.

At the top of `MusicStoreWindow.axaml` you will find some lines that begin `xmlns:x` etc.. add a line:

```markup
xmlns:local="using:Avalonia.MusicStore.Views"
```

Then inside the `<Panel>` add.

```xml
<local:MusicStoreView />
```

Your `MusicStoreWindow.axaml` should look like this.

```xml
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
        xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
        xmlns:local="using:Avalonia.MusicStore.Views"
        mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="800" d:DesignHeight="450"
        x:Class="Avalonia.MusicStore.Views.MusicStoreWindow"
        Title="MusicStoreWindow"
        TransparencyLevelHint="AcrylicBlur"
        ExtendClientAreaToDecorationsHint="True"
        Width="1000" Height="550"
        WindowStartupLocation="CenterOwner">
    <Panel>
        <ExperimentalAcrylicBorder IsHitTestVisible="False">
            <ExperimentalAcrylicBorder.Material>
                <ExperimentalAcrylicMaterial
                    BackgroundSource="Digger"
                    TintColor="Black"
                    TintOpacity="1"
                    MaterialOpacity="0.65" />
            </ExperimentalAcrylicBorder.Material>
        </ExperimentalAcrylicBorder>

        <Panel Margin="40">
            <local:MusicStoreView />
        </Panel>
    </Panel>
</Window>
```

Run the application:

<img className="center" src={MusicStoreMockSearchScreenshot} alt="" />

Our items are showing in the List... but not very visual.

Lets create an `AlbumView` that our `ViewLocator` will find and use instead.

Right click on your `Views` folder and select `Add` → `Avalonia User Control`. When prompted enter the name `AlbumView` and press `Enter`.

For the ViewLocator to do its thing, ensure that `AlbumViewModel` inherits `ViewModelBase`.

```csharp
public class AlbumViewModel : ViewModelBase
{        
}
```

In your newly created `AlbumView` add the following code:

```xml
<StackPanel Spacing="5" Width="200">
    <Border CornerRadius="10" ClipToBounds="True">
        <Panel Background="#7FFF22DD">
            <Image Width="200" Stretch="Uniform" Source="{Binding Cover}" />
            <Panel Height="200" IsVisible="{Binding Cover, Converter={x:Static ObjectConverters.IsNull}}">
                <PathIcon Height="75" Width="75" Data="{StaticResource music_regular}" />
            </Panel>
        </Panel>
    </Border>
    <TextBlock Text="{Binding Title}" HorizontalAlignment="Center" />
    <TextBlock Text="{Binding Artist}" HorizontalAlignment="Center" />
</StackPanel>
```

This shows a `StackPanel` to contain the controls. They are:

A border with a `Corner` radius set, and `ClipToBounds` set to `True`, this means that the content will be clipped with rounded corners.

The border contains a `Panel` with a `Background` set, using a hexadecimal colour code.

This `Panel` contains an `Image` and a `PathIcon` in front of it. Add the source for the Icon to `Icons.axaml`:

```xml
<StreamGeometry x:Key="music_regular">M11.5,2.75 C11.5,2.22634895 12.0230228,1.86388952 12.5133347,2.04775015 L18.8913911,4.43943933 C20.1598961,4.91511241 21.0002742,6.1277638 21.0002742,7.48252202 L21.0002742,10.7513533 C21.0002742,11.2750044 20.4772513,11.6374638 19.9869395,11.4536032 L13,8.83332147 L13,17.5 C13,17.5545945 12.9941667,17.6078265 12.9830895,17.6591069 C12.9940859,17.7709636 13,17.884807 13,18 C13,20.2596863 10.7242052,22 8,22 C5.27579485,22 3,20.2596863 3,18 C3,15.7403137 5.27579485,14 8,14 C9.3521238,14 10.5937815,14.428727 11.5015337,15.1368931 L11.5,2.75 Z M8,15.5 C6.02978478,15.5 4.5,16.6698354 4.5,18 C4.5,19.3301646 6.02978478,20.5 8,20.5 C9.97021522,20.5 11.5,19.3301646 11.5,18 C11.5,16.6698354 9.97021522,15.5 8,15.5 Z M13,3.83223733 L13,7.23159672 L19.5002742,9.669116 L19.5002742,7.48252202 C19.5002742,6.75303682 19.0477629,6.10007069 18.3647217,5.84393903 L13,3.83223733 Z</StreamGeometry>
```

This means that when the `Image` source is not loaded the icon will be shown.

Outside the border we have some `TextBlocks` to show the albums title and artist name.

Notice the `StackPanel` has its `Spacing` property set to 5, this puts a space between each item.

We shall come back to the `Bindings` in a moment, for now lets run the application and see what happens.

As can be seen the albums are displayed vertically. However it would be nice to have them horizontally and wrap around.

<img className="center" src={MusicStoreBeforeWrapPanelScreenshot} alt="" />

Luckily `ListBox` provides a solution to this with something called `ItemsPanelTemplate`. By default the `ListBox` has its `ItemPanel` property set to an `ItemsPanelTemplate` which contains a `StackPanel`, we can change this to a `WrapPanel` like so.

```xml
<ListBox Items="{Binding SearchResults}" SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedAlbum}" Background="Transparent" Margin="0 20">
    <ListBox.ItemsPanel>
        <ItemsPanelTemplate>
            <WrapPanel />
        </ItemsPanelTemplate>
    </ListBox.ItemsPanel>
</ListBox>
```

Now when we run the application we get:

<img className="center" src={MusicStoreWrapPanelScreenshot} alt="" />

As our list gets more items, that will wrap around onto the next line, and the user will be able to scroll.

This is a very powerful and flexible feature in Avalonia. Any layout can be achieved, by implementing your own `Panel` class. However that is outside the scope of this tutorial.
