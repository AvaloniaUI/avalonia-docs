In this tutorial we have shown how Avalonia can be used to create engaging desktop applications. Although we have covered a lot of ground, this is only a small amount of what Avalonia can do. With Avalonia your imagination really is the only limit.

I hope you have enjoyed building this demo application and please get in touch or send a PR with improvements to the tutorial as it will help many others. The repository can be found at [Avalonia.MusicStore](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.MusicStore).
