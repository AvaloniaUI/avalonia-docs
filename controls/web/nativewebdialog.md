`NativeWebDialog` is a dialog window that hosts a native web browser. It is useful on platforms like Linux where an embedded `NativeWebView` control is not available, or when you want to show web content in a separate window without embedding it in your layout.


:::info
This control is available as part of [Avalonia Accelerate](https://avaloniaui.net/accelerate) Business or higher.
:::

## Useful properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Title` | `string?` | The dialog window title. |
| `CanUserResize` | `bool` | Whether the user can resize the dialog. |
| `Source` | `Uri` | The URI of the page displayed in the WebView. Setting this property is equivalent to calling `Navigate()`. Default: `about:blank`. |
| `CanGoBack` | `bool` | Read-only. `true` when the WebView can navigate back in history. |
| `CanGoForward` | `bool` | Read-only. `true` when the WebView can navigate forward in history. |

## Basic example

Create a dialog, navigate to a URL, and wait for it to close:

```csharp
var dialog = new NativeWebDialog
{
    Title = "Avalonia Docs",
    CanUserResize = false,
    Source = new Uri("https://docs.avaloniaui.net/")
};

var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource();
dialog.Closing += (s, e) => tcs.SetResult();

dialog.Show(mainWindow);

await tcs.Task;
```

You can also load HTML directly:

```csharp
var dialog = new NativeWebDialog { Title = "Preview" };
dialog.Show();
dialog.NavigateToString("<h1>Hello from Avalonia</h1>");
```

## Showing the dialog

Call `Show()` to open the dialog as a standalone window, or `Show(IPlatformHandle)` to open it with an owner:

```csharp
// Standalone
dialog.Show();

// With an owner window
dialog.Show(mainWindow);
```

Use `Close()` to dismiss it programmatically. The `Closing` event fires before the dialog closes, allowing you to perform cleanup.

## Navigation

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Navigate(Uri)` | Navigates to the specified URI. |
| `NavigateToString(string)` | Renders an HTML string as the page content. |
| `GoBack()` | Navigates back. Returns `false` if there is no history. |
| `GoForward()` | Navigates forward. Returns `false` if there is no history. |
| `Refresh()` | Reloads the current page. |
| `Stop()` | Stops any in-progress navigation. |

## Running JavaScript

Execute JavaScript in the loaded page and receive the result:

```csharp
var result = await dialog.InvokeScript("document.title");
```

To receive messages from JavaScript, subscribe to `WebMessageReceived`. Web content sends messages by calling `invokeCSharpAction(body)`:

```csharp
dialog.WebMessageReceived += (sender, e) =>
{
    var message = e.Body;
    // Process the message from JavaScript
};
```

## Printing

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `ShowPrintUI()` | Opens the platform print dialog. |
| `PrintToPdfStreamAsync()` | Returns the current page as a PDF stream. |

:::note
`PrintToPdfStreamAsync` does not accept extended print options such as margin or orientation. For broader platform support, use CSS rules with [@media print](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media#print) and [@page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@page).
:::

## Intercepting requests

The `WebResourceRequested` event fires when the WebView makes a URL request, allowing you to inspect or modify headers:

```csharp
dialog.WebResourceRequested += (sender, e) =>
{
    // Inspect e.Request and e.Headers
};
```

:::note
The headers dictionary can be read-only depending on the request or platform. Always check the result of the `TrySet` and `TryRemove` methods.
:::

## Environment options

The `EnvironmentRequested` event fires before the WebView adapter is created, letting you customize options such as enabling private mode or developer tools:

```csharp
dialog.EnvironmentRequested += (sender, e) =>
{
    // Configure WebView environment before initialization
};
```

See [WebView environment options](/docs/webview/webview-environment) for details. The event argument type depends on the platform.

## Window sizing and position

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Resize(int, int)` | Resizes the dialog to the specified width and height. |
| `Move(int, int)` | Moves the dialog to the specified screen coordinates. |

## Advanced

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `TryGetCommandManager()` | Returns a `NativeWebViewCommandManager` for keyboard commands (copy, paste, etc.) if supported. |
| `TryGetCookieManager()` | Returns a `NativeWebViewCookieManager` for managing cookies if supported. |
| `TryGetWebViewPlatformHandle()` | Returns the platform handle of the hosted WebView. See [embedding web content](/docs/app-development/embedding-web-content). |
| `TryGetPlatformHandle()` | Returns the platform handle of the dialog window itself. |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `Closing` | Fires before the dialog closes. |
| `AdapterCreated` | Fires after the WebView adapter has been initialized. |
| `AdapterDestroyed` | Fires after the WebView adapter has been destroyed. |
| `EnvironmentRequested` | Fires before the WebView adapter is created. Used to configure environment options. |
| `NavigationStarted` | Fires before a new navigation begins. |
| `NavigationCompleted` | Fires after navigation completes (successfully or not). |
| `NewWindowRequested` | Fires when the WebView requests opening a new window (for example, from `window.open()`). |
| `WebMessageReceived` | Fires when web content calls `invokeCSharpAction(body)`. |
| `WebResourceRequested` | Fires when the WebView makes a URL request. |

## Platform support

| Feature | Windows | macOS | Linux | iOS | Android | Browser |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Show` | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| `Show(Window)` | Yes | Yes | Yes* | No | No | No |
| `WebMessageReceived` | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| `ShowPrintUI` | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| `PrintToPdfStreamAsync` | Yes | Yes** | Yes | No | No | No |

\* Linux support may vary depending on the window manager.

\** macOS does not support extended `PrintToPdfStreamAsync` print options. Use CSS `@media print` and `@page` rules instead.
