# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

### Developer Tools requirements

| Requirement | Version/Details |
|------------|-----------------|
| .NET Runtime | 6.0 or newer |
| Windows | 10 or newer |
| macOS | 13 or newer |
| Linux | X11 and glibc 2.27 or musl 1.22.2 compatible distros |

No admin/sudo permissions are required to run the tool. A firewall exception might need to be configured, if you plan to use Developer Tools remotely.

### Diagnostics Support requirements

Support package requires **Avalonia 11.2.0** or newer, and built on **.NET Standard 2.0** compatible APIs.

This package is compatible with Browser and Android/iOS projects.

:::note

Demo project with Developer Tools preconfigured can be found at [AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools/samples/SimpleToDoList](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools/tree/main/samples/SimpleToDoList#simpletodolist).

## Step 1: Installing AvaloniaUI Developer Tools

AvaloniaUI Developer Tools is currently a native [.NET tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools), with update mechanism provided by the SDK.
This guide demonstrates global installation of the tool. But local installation is possible with a limitation: this tool will only work from the same working directory or descendant as the tool installation solution/project.

<TabItem value="net10" label=".NET 10+" default>

```bash
dotnet tool install --global AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools
```

The Developer Tools will notify you when a new version is available. It can be then updated by running `dotnet tool update` command.

<summary>Developer tools update command</summary>

```bash
dotnet tool update --global AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools
```

</details>


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="net6" label=".NET 8">

Before .NET 10, you have to install specific package depending on the running platform.

**Windows:**

```bash
dotnet tool install --global AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools.Windows
```

**macOS:**

```bash
dotnet tool install --global AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools.macOS
```

**Linux:**

```bash
dotnet tool install --global AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools.Linux
```

The Developer Tools will notify you when a new version is available. It can be then updated by running `dotnet tool update` command.

**Windows:**

```bash
dotnet tool update --global AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools.Windows
```

**macOS:**

```bash
dotnet tool update --global AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools.macOS
```

**Linux:**

```bash
dotnet tool update --global AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools.Linux
```

</details>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Installing Diagnostics Support package

The `Diagnostics Support` package is responsible for establishing a connection bridge between the user app and Developer Tools process.

This package can be installed either in the executable project with your Program AppBuilder or shared project with your Application, depending on your application's architecture.

In both cases, command is the same:

```bash
dotnet add package AvaloniaUI.DiagnosticsSupport
```

:::note

Old package `Avalonia.Diagnostics` can be safely removed. It's not used by new `Developer Tools`.

:::

## Step 3: Configuring your project

Once the `DiagnosticsSupport` package is installed, you need to enable it in your `Application` class:

```csharp
public override void Initialize()
{
    AvaloniaXamlLoader.Load(this);

#if DEBUG
    this.AttachDeveloperTools();
#endif
}
```

Alternatively, it's possible to use `.WithDeveloperTools()` extension method on your AppBuilder.

These methods also accept `DeveloperToolsOptions` options class allowing to customize `Diagnostics Support` setup. See [Reference to DeveloperToolsOptions](./advanced/options-reference.md) for more details.

By default, **29414** is used and should be available. It is configurable via options.

## Step 4: Run the tool

When your target app is running, press F12 to initialize connection.
`Diagnostics Support` will automatically run `Developer Tools` executable and initiate connection between processes.
Initial execution on `macOS` might take several seconds due to Gatekeeper validation. Subsequent launches will be faster.

## Step 5: Activate the tool

Once the Developer Tools has opened, you will be asked to input `AvaloniaUI Portal` credentials that were used to license the tool. This is the only time when the tool requires an internet connection. After that, the tool can be used offline or until license key session expires.

## Step 6: Done!

After activation, the connection with the app will be resumed, and a window with tools will be opened.
