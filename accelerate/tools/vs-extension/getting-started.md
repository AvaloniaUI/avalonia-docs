## Features

The extension provides an enhanced way of working with Avalonia XAML files. It does this by providing:

- An enhanced editor with deep integrations for a rich editing experience.
- A Previewer so you can see what the UI will look like without having to run the application.

### Enhanced Editor

The editor for Avalonia XAML includes the following capabilities:

- Intellisense auto-complete while typing.
- Error highlighting and fix suggestions.
- Full colorization of the XAML.
- "Go To Definition" navigation.
- Quick Info for when hovering over an element or attribute.
- Automatic document formatting.
- Outlining of the document so you can collapse elements.

### Previewer

The previewer allows you to see what the UI of the open document will look like without needing to run the application.

The image below shows a window from a sample app open, with the previewer to the right of the source.
