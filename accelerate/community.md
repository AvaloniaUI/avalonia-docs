Community License registration is available at the [Avalonia portal](https://portal.avaloniaui.net).

## Telemetry and Data Collection

To improve Avalonia and ensure continued support for free community tools, Avalonia Accelerate collects usage telemetry and crash reports. This data helps us understand tool usage and identify issues.

### Build Telemetry

During the build process, Avalonia collects anonymous usage statistics. **All telemetry data is stored and processed in Europe** and complies with GDPR requirements. Telemetry is only collected during builds and does not impact your applications built with Avalonia.

#### Data Collected

The following information is collected during builds:

- **RecordId**: Unique identifier for the telemetry record (GUID)
- **TimeStamp**: When the build occurred (DateTimeOffset)
- **Machine**: Anonymous machine identifier (GUID)
- **ProjectRootHash**: Hashed project root path (string)
- **ProjectHash**: Hashed project identifier (string)
- **Ide**: Development environment being used (enum: Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code, etc.)
- **CiProvider**: CI/CD system if applicable (enum: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- **OutputType**: Application output type (string: exe, library, etc.)
- **Tfm**: Target framework moniker - .NET version (string)
- **Rid**: Runtime identifier - platform and architecture (string)
- **AvaloniaMainPackageVersion**: Version of Avalonia being used (string)
- **OSDescription**: Operating system information (string)
- **ProcessorArchitecture**: CPU architecture (enum: x64, ARM64, etc.)
- **DeviceUniqueId**: Anonymous device identifier (string)
- **AccelerateTier**: License tier (enum: Community, Business, Enterprise, etc.)
- **OperatingSystem**: Operating system name (string)

#### How Telemetry Works

The telemetry system looks for license keys in the `LicenseTickets` directory to determine your license tier and telemetry settings. Uninstalling Accelerate tools is not sufficient to restore pre-Accelerate telemetry behavior (see "Uninstalling the Community Edition" below).

#### Verifying Telemetry Data

For complete transparency, we've made the telemetry collection code open source:

- **Source code**: [AvaloniaStatsTask.cs](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.BuildServices/blob/main/BuildTask/AvaloniaStatsTask.cs) - Review exactly what data is collected and how.
- **Telemetry Inspector**: A utility application for viewing the telemetry data being collected. Clone and build from [GitHub](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.BuildServices/tree/main/TelemetryInspector) to verify the data yourself.

### Crash Reporting (Parcel and Dev Tools Only)

Avalonia Parcel and Dev Tools use Sentry for crash reporting. This is separate from usage telemetry and **only applies to crashes in the Avalonia Accelerate tools themselves**, not your applications built with Avalonia.

#### What's Collected

When a crash occurs in Parcel or Dev Tools, the following diagnostic information is sent to Sentry:

- Exception messages and stack traces
- Environment metadata (OS version, .NET version, etc.)
- Machine identifiers (random GUID)
- Context about the operation that crashed

#### Privacy Safeguards

1. **Scope**: Crash reporting only applies to Dev Tools and Parcel, **not applications you build** with Avalonia, or the Visual Studio extension. 

2. **Automatic Data Scrubbing**: We use Sentry's server-side Advanced Data Scrubbing to automatically remove common personally identifiable information (PII) patterns before or at ingestion, including:
   - Email addresses
   - IP addresses
   - Authentication tokens
   - Credit card numbers

3. **Residual PII Disclosure**: Despite these safeguards, we acknowledge that incidental PII may remain embedded in crash data, for example, usernames or machine names appearing in file paths or custom error messages. Under GDPR, such residual data is treated as personal data and handled accordingly.

4. **Data Location**: All crash data is processed in Europe, in compliance with GDPR requirements.

### Data Transparency Commitment

While telemetry helps us improve Avalonia and justify the resources invested in free community tools, we respect your choice to opt out. See the "Uninstalling the Community Edition" section below for complete removal instructions.

## Uninstalling the Community Edition

If you wish to remove the Accelerate tools and restore telemetry behavior, please follow these steps carefully.

### Step 1: Uninstall the Tools

First, uninstall the Avalonia Accelerate tools using standard uninstallation methods:

**For .NET Tools (Parcel, Dev Tools):**
```bash
dotnet tool uninstall -g Avalonia.Parcel
dotnet tool uninstall -g Avalonia.DevTools
```

**For Visual Studio Extension:**
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Go to Extensions > Manage Extensions
3. Find the Avalonia extension and click Uninstall
4. Restart Visual Studio

### Step 2: Remove License Data (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Simply uninstalling the tools is **NOT sufficient** to restore pre-Accelerate telemetry settings. 

Due to a general limitation of .NET tools, license data is not automatically removed during uninstallation. You must manually delete the license data directory to completely restore previous telemetry behavior.

**Windows:**

Delete the following directory:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Avalonia\LicenseTickets
```

To delete this folder:
1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog
2. Type `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Avalonia\LicenseTickets` and press Enter
3. Delete the entire `LicenseTickets` folder

**macOS/Linux:**

Delete the following directory:
```bash
~/.local/share/Avalonia/LicenseTickets
```

To delete this folder:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/Avalonia/LicenseTickets
```

### Why This Manual Step Is Necessary

The Avalonia telemetry task ([source code](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.BuildServices/blob/main/BuildTask/AvaloniaStatsTask.cs)) looks for license keys in the `LicenseTickets` directory to determine your license tier and telemetry settings. 

When you uninstall .NET tools, this directory is not automatically removed due to a limitation of .NET tools. This means the telemetry system continues to operate under Community License settings even after uninstalling the tools.

By manually removing this directory, you ensure that:
- License information is completely cleared from your system.
- Telemetry reverts to pre-Accelerate behavior.

## Startup Program for Growing Companies

For privately held companies **less than 5 years old** with annual revenue or total institutional funding below **€10M**, Avalonia offers a **50% discount** on Accelerate Enterprise through the [Startup Program](https://avaloniaui.net/startups).


## License Compliance

By using the Avalonia Community License, you agree to:
- Accurately represent your eligibility status.
- Use the tools only for qualifying purposes.
- Comply with all telemetry and data collection terms.
- Upgrade to a paid license if your circumstances change and you no longer qualify.

For complete legal terms, refer to the [Accelerate Community License Agreement](https://avaloniaui.net/legal-center/accelerate-community-license).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a license to use Avalonia?

No. **Avalonia UI itself remains entirely open-source under the MIT license.** You can build and ship commercial applications with Avalonia completely free, forever. The Community License only applies to the professional tooling (Visual Studio extension, Dev Tools, Parcel), not the framework itself.

### What if I don't want any of this?

That's completely fine. All the legacy tooling remains open-source and available on GitHub:
- The existing Visual Studio extension
- Dev Tools
- TreeDataGrid

You can continue using them as they are today, or fork and maintain them independently if you prefer.

### Can I continue using the legacy tools?

Yes. The legacy FOSS Visual Studio extension remains available to clone and build at [github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaVS](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaVS). The legacy Dev Tools source remains available. The original TreeDataGrid remains available. All are MIT licensed and can be used, forked, or maintained by anyone.

### When does my Community License expire?

Community Licenses do not expire as long as you remain eligible. However, if your circumstances change (e.g., your organization grows beyond the eligibility thresholds), you must upgrade to a paid license.

### What happens after the Visual Studio grace period?

After April 13th 2026, if you haven't registered for a Community License or purchased a paid license, you can:
- Continue using the legacy FOSS Visual Studio extension
- Switch to Visual Studio Code or JetBrains Rider (extensions remain freely available)
- Register for a Community License if eligible
- Purchase a paid license
