## General

### Do I need a license to use Avalonia?

No. **Avalonia UI itself remains entirely open-source under the MIT license.** You can build and ship commercial applications with Avalonia completely free, forever. The Community License only applies to the professional tooling (Visual Studio extension, Dev Tools, Parcel), not the framework itself.

### What if I don't want any of this?

That's completely fine. All the legacy tooling remains open-source and available on GitHub:
- The existing Visual Studio extension
- Dev Tools
- TreeDataGrid

You can continue using them as they are today, or fork and maintain them independently if you prefer.

### Can I continue using the legacy tools?

Yes. The legacy FOSS Visual Studio extension remains available to clone and build at [github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaVS](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaVS). The legacy Dev Tools source remains available. The original TreeDataGrid remains available. All are MIT licensed and can be used, forked, or maintained by anyone.

### When does my Community License expire?

Community Licenses do not expire as long as you remain eligible. However, if your circumstances change (e.g., your organization grows beyond the eligibility thresholds), you must upgrade to a paid license.

### What happens after the Visual Studio grace period?

After April 13th 2026, if you haven't registered for a Community License or purchased a paid license, you can:
- Continue using the legacy FOSS Visual Studio extension
- Switch to Visual Studio Code or JetBrains Rider (extensions remain freely available)
- Register for a Community License if eligible
- Purchase a paid license
