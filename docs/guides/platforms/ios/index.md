# ðŸ‘‰ How To Develop For Mobile iOS

In this section we describe how to setup you machine for iOS development. Then, if you have a Mac, how to run it on a simulator or an actual iPhone or iPad.

:::info
Due to Apple's policies it is unfortunately not possible to run the iOS simulators or test on an iPhone or iPad without a genuine Apple device running macOS and Xcode.

We hope this might change in the future, if you do not have access to a Mac, a workaround is to run your application in a Window sized appropriately. Or follow the guides on Android.

You should always test on a real device before releasing.
:::

Before getting started ensure you have followed the guide [Building Cross Platform Applications](../../building-cross-platform-applications).
