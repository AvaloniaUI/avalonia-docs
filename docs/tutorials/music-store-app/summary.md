# Conclusion

In this tutorial you have seen how _Avalonia UI_ can be used to create a highly graphical desktop app.

## Application Solution Architecture

This tutorial has used an application solution architecture that uses the MVVM pattern with the help of the _ReactiveUI_ framework. It manages multiple windows from the code-behind files.

Application state is kept in the 'top level' view model, and can be persisted to disk. The main window and search dialog are composed from in _Avalonia UI_ window controls, built-in controls and user controls.

This tutorial application targets a windowing platform such as _Apple Mac OS_ or _Windows_.
