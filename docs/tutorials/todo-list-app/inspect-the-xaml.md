# Inspect the XAML

This is a good time for you to take a look at the code generated by the view template.

Start with the root element, its declarations of namespaces and settings:

```xml
 <UserControl 
    xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
    mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="250" d:DesignHeight="450"
    x:Class="ToDoList.Views.ToDoListView">
```

The root element in the XAML file starts `<UserControl` and this is followed by a number of XML  `xmlns` namespace declarations common to _Avalonia UI_ controls.  The most important declaration to note is the first one:

```xml
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui" ... >
```

This declares that the XAML in the file contains _Avalonia UI_ XAML.

:::warning
Without this entry nothing will work in your _Avalonia UI_ project!
:::

The next namespace is `xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"` and this is used to import Microsoft XAML language features that are used by _Avalonia UI_.

:::info
For more information see the Microsoft documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/xaml-services/namespace-language-features).
:::

The remaining two namespaces are used to communicate information to the _Avalonia UI_ designer (code and preview panes).

```xml
<UserControl ...
     xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
     xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006" ... > 
```

For example, as you have already done, you can specify the width and height of the control as it is displayed in the designer preview pane:

<pre class="language-xml"><code class="lang-xml">&#x3C;UserControl ...
<strong>mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="250" d:DesignHeight="450" ... ></strong></code></pre>

The entry `mc:Ignorable="d"` tells the _Avalonia UI_ XAML engine that entries beginning with `d:` can be ignored at runtime.

The last line links the XAML file with its code-behind class. Note that the fully-qualified class name has to be used here.

```xml
<UserControl ...
   x:Class="ToDoList.Views.ToDoListView">
```

## Control Content

The content zone of the user control is occupied by a dock panel:

```xml
<DockPanel>
```

:::info
To review the concept of layout zones, see [here](../../concepts/layout/layout-zones).
:::

A user control can only contain a single child control in its content zone; so you will often need to start a layout with one of the _Avalonia UI_ panel controls, as these allow you to contain multiple child controls in the space instead.

:::info
You can browse the full range of _Avalonia UI_ panel controls in the reference section  [here](../../reference/controls/panel.md).
:::

In this example, you are using the dock panel `<DockPanel>` control. This is a type of panel which lays out its child controls along the edges of its content zone. Each child control can specify which edge: top, bottom, left or right. This is done using the `DockPanel.Dock` attribute. For example, this XAML aligns a button at the bottom of the view; and it is stretched to fit the width, with its text centered.

```xml
<Button DockPanel.Dock="Bottom"
    HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"
    HorizontalContentAlignment="Center">Add Item</Button>
```

In a dock panel there must be a single control filling the remaining space in its content zone (wherever that is located); or it will not display correctly. This filling control must have no `DockPanel.Dock` attribute. The tutorial uses a stack panel to fill the remainng space:

```xml
<StackPanel>
```

The stack panel lays out its child controls in a stack, which is vertical by default. (You can make the stack horizontal by setting the `Orientation` attribute.) You will often use the stack panel in your _Avalonia UI_ layouts.

:::info
To more detail about the stack panel, see the reference [here](../../reference/controls/stackpanel.md).
:::

The remaining XAML adds the hard-coded to do list items as check boxes:

```xml
<CheckBox Margin="4">Walk the dog</CheckBox>
<CheckBox Margin="4">Buy some milk</CheckBox>
```

Notice that these controls have the margin attribute set. This will separate them a little visually.

:::info
The margin is one of the _Avalonia UI_ control layout zones. To review the concept of layout zones, see [here](../../concepts/layout/layout-zones).
