# Set Up an Editor

You can create an Avalonia application using any code editor, but using an IDE will give you support for authoring Avalonia XAML files with a previewer and code completion.

## JetBrains Rider

The [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) IDE has built-in support for Avalonia XAML [starting in 2020.3](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/whatsnew/2020-3/#version-2020-3-avalonia-support) including first-class support for Avalonia-specific XAML features and custom code inspections.

See the [JetBrains Rider 2020.3 release announcement](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/whatsnew/2020-3/#version-2020-3-avalonia-support) for more information.

Rider does not yet provide a visual designer, but this is in development. See [the GitHub project](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/AvaloniaRider) for more information and instructions on how to install.

## Visual Studio

If you're developing Avalonia with Visual Studio you should install the [Avalonia for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AvaloniaTeam.AvaloniaVS) extension.
