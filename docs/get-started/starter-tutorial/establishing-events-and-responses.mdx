# Establishing events and responses

Our temperature converter app now looks reasonably functional, but doesn’t do anything yet. The next thing we need is for the **Calculate** button to be able to respond to a user action, such as a click.

## Creating an event handler with code-behind

XAML files can be associated with a C# source file. This file is where we can code event handling for the button. We call this “code-behind”.

1. In your IDE, browse your project directory for **Views → MainWindow.axaml → MainWindow.axaml.cs**. This is the C# source file behind the main window XAML.

<Image light={MainWindowCodeBehindLocation} alt="A screenshot showing the location of the main window's code-behind file in a file tree." position="center" maxWidth={400} cornerRadius="true"/>

2. Open **MainWindow.axaml.cs**.
3. Locate the `using` directives at the top of the file. At this point, there should only be the single line `using Avalonia.Controls;`. Add these two `using` directives:

```cs
using Avalonia.Interactivity;
using System.Diagnostics;
```

4. Locate the line `public partial class MainWindow : Window` further down the file. This class currently contains only the constructor for the main window, `public MainWindow()`. Below the constructor, add the following code:

```cs
private void Button_OnClick(object? sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Debug.WriteLine("Click!");
}
```

5. Your C# file should now look like this:

```cs
using Avalonia.Controls;
using Avalonia.Interactivity;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace GetStartedApp.Views;

public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }
    
    private void Button_OnClick(object? sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine("Click!");
    }
}
```

6. Switch to your XAML file, **MainWindow.axaml**.
7. Locate `<Button>` near the bottom of the file.
8. Add `Click` as an attribute to the `<Button>` tag and associate it with `Button_OnClick`, like so:

```xml
<Button HorizontalAlignment="Center" Click="Button_OnClick">Calculate</Button>
```

## Checking the event handler works

To verify we’ve created the event handler correctly, we can check the debug output to confirm "Click!" is being printed when we click the **Calculate** button.

<Tabs groupId="ide">  
  <TabItem value="rider" label="Rider">
	1. Run GetStartedApp in debug mode.

    <Image light={RiderRunDebugMode} alt="A screenshot showing the location of the button to run a project in debug mode in Rider." position="center" maxWidth={400} cornerRadius="true"/>

	2. Open the **Debug Output** tab in the bottom panel.
    3. In the running app window, click the **Calculate** button a few times.
    4. You should see “Click!” being printed in the debug output in Rider.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vs" label="Visual Studio">
    1. Go to the **Output** window, located by default under the split view. From the “Show output from:” dropdown menu, select **Debug**.
    2. Run the app.
    3. In the running app window, click the **Calculate** button a few times.
    4. You should see “Click!” printed in the output window.

    <Image light={VsDebugOutputClick} alt="A screenshot showing the output screen in Visual Studio, with the word 'Click!' printed inside." position="center" maxWidth={400} cornerRadius="true"/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
