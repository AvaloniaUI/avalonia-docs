# Adding a control

The first step for our temperature converter app is to add a **control**. By “controls”, we mean UI elements that allow interaction with your app. Some examples of controls are buttons, sliders, checkboxes or menus.

For more information on controls, see the [Controls reference page](/docs/reference/controls).

## Inserting a button

Let’s try replacing the text in the app with a button.

1. Stop the app if it is still running.
2. In the file **MainWindow.axaml**, locate this line:

```xml
<TextBlock Text="{Binding Greeting}" HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center"/>
```

3. Replace the entire line with this:

```xml
<Button>Calculate</Button>
```

4. Run the app or check the previewer. You should now see a **Calculate** button in the app window.
5. You can try hovering over or clicking the button to see how its appearance changes.

<div className="center" style={{maxWidth:400}}>
<img className="center" src={CalculateButtonLeft} alt="A screenshot of an app running in a window, with the button aligned left." />
</div>

## Setting the button's attributes

Controls in Avalonia use XML attributes to specify their presentation and behavior.

Your **Calculate** button is currently aligned against the left edge of the window. This is because the default value of the `HorizontalAlignment` attribute is `Left`. Let’s change this attribute to put the button in the center instead.

1. In the file **MainWindow.axaml**, go to the line you added for the button:

```xml
<Button>Calculate</Button>
```

2. Add the `HorizontalAlignment` attribute to the `<Button>` tag. Set it to `Center`.

```xml
<Button HorizontalAlignment="Center">Calculate</Button>
```

3. Run the app or check the previewer. You should see that the Calculate button moves to the center of the window.

<div className="center" style={{maxWidth:400}}>
<img className="center" src={CalculateButtonCenter} alt="A screenshot of an app running in a window, with the button aligned center." />
</div>

On the next page of this tutorial, you will learn how to add multiple elements to your app using layout controls.

<br />
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '10px' }}>
  <Button label="Adding some layout →" link="/docs/get-started/starter-tutorial/adding-some-layout" variant="primary" outline />
</div>
