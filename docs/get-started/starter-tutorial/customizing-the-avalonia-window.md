# Customizing the Avalonia window

As [mentioned earlier](/docs/get-started/starter-tutorial), the Avalonia window is where your app will run on the target platform. In a .axaml file, the `<Window>...</Window>` tag defines what goes in the window.

## Layout zones

Avalonia windows have four layout zones: (1) Margin, (2) Border, (3) Padding, and (4) Content.

Some layout controls, like `StackPanel` which you used earlier, create smaller sub-windows with the same four layout zones.

:::note
Each Avalonia window only accepts one control in its content zone.

<div className="center" style={{maxWidth:400}}>
<img className="center" src={AvaloniaWindowLayout} alt="A diagram displaying four overlapping, rectangular areas, representing the Avalonia window." />
</div>

## Default window attributes

Like controls, windows in Avalonia have XML attributes that define their presentation and behavior.

Scroll to the top of the file **MainWindow.axaml** and examine the `<Window>` opening tag. You can see that it contains some default settings.

```xml
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:vm="using:GetStartedApp.ViewModels"
        xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
        xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
        mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="800" d:DesignHeight="450"
        x:Class="GetStartedApp.Views.MainWindow"
        x:DataType="vm:MainWindowViewModel"
        Icon="/Assets/avalonia-logo.ico"
        Title="GetStartedApp">
```

:::note
The first few lines of the `<Window>` tag declare the XML namespaces used by Avalonia. We use the namespace aliases `x`, `vm`, `d` and `mc`.

## Setting the window's attributes

Let’s try adjusting the window’s dimensions so that it appears to be in portrait orientation, instead of landscape. This is something you may do when developing an app, to check how it looks on a mobile device.

### Setting the previewer size

Adjusting the values in `d:DesignWidth` and `d:DesignHeight` allows you to change the dimensions of the app in the live previewer, without affecting the actual dimensions of the window at runtime.

1. In the file **MainWindow.axaml**, locate this line within the `<Window>...</Window>` tag:

```xml
mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="800" d:DesignHeight="450"
```

2. Set `d:DesignWidth` to 400.
3. Observe the previewer. You should see that the preview now resembles a mobile display.

<div className="center" style={{maxWidth:400}}>
<img className="center" src={TemperatureConverterPortraitOrientation} alt="A screenshot of an app running in a window in portrait orientation." />
</div>

### Setting the runtime window size

To adjust to dimensions of the runtime app window, you need to add `Width` and `Height` attributes to the `<Window>` opening tag.

1. In the file **MainWindow.axaml**, go to the bottom line of the `<Window>` opening tag: 

```xml
Title="GetStartedApp">
```

2. Add the attributes `Width="400"` and `Height="450"` under that line. Remember to move the angle bracket to the end.

```xml
Title="GetStartedApp"
Width="400"
Height="450">
```

3. Run the app. You should see that the app window now resembles a mobile display.

:::note
Most mobile platforms actually ignore window sizes and automatically resize windows to fit the screen. When developing, you won’t literally need to set a separate size for each target platform.
