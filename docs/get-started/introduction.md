You can use this section to get started straight away with _Avalonia UI_ and _Visual Studio_. This will take you through a simple tutorial example step-by-step; and introduce you to some of the _Avalonia UI_ concepts and techniques.

You do not need any prior knowledge of _Avalonia UI_ or other XAML-based frameworks to learn from this section. You will need _Microsoft Visual Studio_ installed.

Click <Highlight color="#25c2a0">**Next**</Highlight> (right-arrow) to get started.

If you are a more experienced user, you may want to extend your knowledge of _Avalonia UI_ instead, by using our Basics section [here](../basics) or one of the How-To Guides [here](../guides).
