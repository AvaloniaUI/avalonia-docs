# DependencyProperty

The Avalonia equivalent of `DependencyProperty` is `StyledProperty`, however Avalonia [has a richer property system than WPF](../../guides/custom-controls/defining-properties), and includes `DirectProperty` for turning standard CLR properties into Avalonia properties. The common base class of `StyledProperty` and `DirectProperty` is `AvaloniaProperty`.
