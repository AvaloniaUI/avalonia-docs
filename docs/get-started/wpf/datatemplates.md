# Data Templates

In Avalonia UI, data templates are not stored in the application resources. (The same is true of styles - see [here](styling).)

Instead, data templates are placed either inside a `DataTemplates` collection in a control, or inside the  (and on `Application`):

For example, this code adds a data template to display the view model class `MyViewModel`:

```xml
<UserControl xmlns:viewmodels="using:MyApp.ViewModels"
             x:DataType="viewmodels:ControlViewModel">
    <UserControl.DataTemplates>
        <DataTemplate DataType="viewmodels:FooViewModel">
            <Border Background="Red" CornerRadius="8">
                <TextBox Text="{Binding Name}"/>
            </Border>
        </DataTemplate>
    </UserControl.DataTemplates>
    <!-- Assuming that ControlViewModel.Foo is an object of type
         MyApp.ViewModels.FooViewModel then a red border with a corner
         radius of 8 containing a TextBox will be displayed here.
         DataType is required only if you use Compiled Bindings, so it can be type-checked.  -->
    <ContentControl Content="{Binding Foo}"/>
</UserControl>
```

Data templates in Avalonia can also target interfaces and derived classes (which cannot be done in WPF) and so the order of `DataTemplate`s can be important: `DataTemplate`s within the same collection are evaluated in declaration order so you need to place them from most-specific to least-specific as you would in code.

## Data Template Selector

In WPF you can create a `DataTemplateSelector` to select or create a `DataTemplate` based on the provided data. In Avalonia you cannot do this; but you can implement `IDataTemplate` which can be seen as a good replacement for the `DataTemplateSelector`. Please find a sample [here](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.Samples/tree/main/src/Avalonia.Samples/DataTemplates/IDataTemplateSample).
