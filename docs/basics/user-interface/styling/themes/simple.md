## Introduction

Avalonia Simple theme is specifically designed to be minimal and lightweight, with limited built-in styling. It provides a simple and clean foundation for building custom styles on top. Low visual and structural complexity makes it a perfect choice for applications running on embedded devices.

## How to use

As a first step, [Avalonia.Themes.Simple](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Avalonia.Themes.Simple/) nuget package needs to be installed.

After that theme needs to be included in the Application class:

             x:Class="AvaloniaApplication.App">
  <Application.Styles>
    // highlight-start
    <SimpleTheme />
    // highlight-end
  </Application.Styles>
</Application>

```
