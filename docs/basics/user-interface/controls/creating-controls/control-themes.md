# Defining a ControlTheme

Avalonia allows you to define custom control themes to customize the appearance and style of your controls. In particular, a lookless control will have no visual representation without a control theme; however you can define control themes for all types of control.


See the introduction to [control themes](../../styling/control-themes) for more information.
