The Avalonia team has been working hard on this release and we're excited to share with you all the new features and improvements. Let's dive in!

## New Features

### A11y (Accessibility)
This version of Avalonia takes major strides in making applications more accessible. We've added support for various accessibility tools, making it easier for everyone to use Avalonia applications.

### IME (Input Method Editor) Support
We have introduced support for Input Method Editor (IME), facilitating users to input characters and symbols not found on their input devices.

### Composition Renderer
The new composition renderer enhances the graphical rendering capabilities, providing a more robust, efficient, and flexible rendering pipeline.

### WebAssembly (WASM) Support
WASM support allows Avalonia applications to run directly in the browser, broadening our platform support and giving developers more freedom and flexibility.

### iOS and Android Support
We've added support for both iOS and Android platforms. Developers can now build and run Avalonia applications on two of the most popular mobile platforms.

### Text Inlines
With the Text Inlines feature, you can easily construct complex formatted text blocks. It enables you to add annotations, hyperlinks, and other inline elements in your text.

### Smooth Virtualization (Reworked ItemsControl)
We've completely reworked the ItemsControl to provide smooth virtualization. This improves the efficiency and user experience for controls with many items.

### Performance Improvements
Avalonia 11.0 comes with significant performance improvements, enhancing the speed and efficiency of your applications.

### Control Themes, Nested Styles, and Theme Variants
We've added the ability to theme controls, apply nested styles, and choose theme variants. This makes it easier to build beautiful and consistent UIs.
 
### Bitmap Effects
The Bitmap Effects feature lets you apply visual effects to bitmaps. You can add blur, drop shadows, and other effects to images.

### 3D Transforms
With 3D Transforms, you can now create stunning three-dimensional effects in your UI.

### AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compilation and Trimming
AOT compilation enables your apps to run faster by compiling them before runtime. Trimming reduces the size of your apps by removing unused code.

### GPU Interop
The GPU Interop feature allows Avalonia to work more efficiently with the GPU, improving rendering performance and visuals.

### Experimental Metal Support
We're testing Metal support to improve performance on iOS and macOS devices.
