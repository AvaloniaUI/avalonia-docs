## What is Avalonia?

Avalonia is an open-source, cross-platform UI framework for creating apps with .NET. Applications built with Avalonia can be deployed to Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, WebAssembly and more.

Avalonia uses its own rendering engine to draw UI controls, ensuring consistency across platforms. A single codebase, in C# or F#, is all that's needed for a uniform look and feel on any device.

## Who is Avalonia for?

Use Avalonia if you want to:

- Build cross-platform apps from a single, shared codebase.
- Have a consistent UI, layout and design on all devices.
- Share code, tests and business logic across all platforms.
