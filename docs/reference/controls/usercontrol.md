[`UserControl`](https://api-docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/T_Avalonia_Controls_UserControl) control is a [ContentControl](contentcontrol) that represents a reusable collection of controls in a predefined layout.

`UserControl` actually provides very little functionality on top of `ContentControl`. The difference is that you will not usually create instances of the `UserControl` class directly; instead a new subclass of the `UserControl` class is usually created for each "view" to be shown by an application.
