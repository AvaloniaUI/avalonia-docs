# TreeDataGrid

The `TreeDataGrid` displays hierarchical and tabular data together in a single view. It is a combination of a tree view and data grid.

:::info
For full information on the tree view control, see the reference [here](../treeview-1.md).

:::info
For full information on the data grid control, see the reference [here](../datagrid/).
:::

The control has two modes of operation:

* _Hierarchical -_ data is displayed in a tree with optional columns
* _Flat -_ data is displayed in a two dimensional table, similar to the data grid control

## Hierarchical Data

This is an illustration of a tree data grid displaying hierarchical data:

## Flat Data

This is an illustration An example of  a tree data grid displaying flat data:

## NuGet Package Reference

You must install the _NuGet_ package for the data grid, there are several ways of doing this. You can use **Manage NuGet Packages** from the project menu of your IDE:

<img src={TreeDataGridNuGetScreenshot} alt=""/>
Alternatively,  you can run this instruction from the command line:

```bash
dotnet add package Avalonia.Controls.TreeDataGrid
```

Or add package reference directly to the project (`.csproj`) file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Avalonia.Controls.TreeDataGrid" Version="11.0.0" />
```

:::warning
Note you must always install the data grid version that matches the _Avalonia UI_ version you are using.
:::

## Include Data Grid Styles

You must reference the data grid themes to include the additional styles that the tree data grid uses. You can do this by adding a `<StyleInclude>` element to the application (`App.axaml` file).

For example:

```xml
<Application xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             x:Class="AvaloniaApplication.App">
  <Application.Styles>
    <FluentTheme/>
    <StyleInclude 
        Source="avares://Avalonia.Controls.TreeDataGrid/Themes/Fluent.axaml"/>
  </Application.Styles>
</Application>
```

## Useful Properties

You will probably use these properties most often:

| Property               | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Source`               | The bound collection that is used as the data source for the control.                         |
| `CanUserResizeColumns` | Indicates whether the user can adjust column widths using the pointer. (Default is false.)    |
| `CanUserSortColumns`   | Indicates whether the user can sort columns by clicking the column header. (Default is true.) |

## Source

You will use the `Source` property to bind to a view model that is defined in code. The view model  includes the definition of how the columns map to the properties of the class that holds the grid items.
