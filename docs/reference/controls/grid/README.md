# Grid

The `Grid` control is useful for arranging child controls in columns and rows. You can define absolute, proportional, and 
autosized row and column geometries for the `Grid`.

Each child control in the `Grid` can be positioned in a `Grid` cell using column and row coordinates. These are 
zero-based, and both have a zero default.

If you position multiple child controls in the same cell, they will be drawn in that cell in the sequence they appear 
in the XAML. This is another strategy to implement layer stacking besides `Panel`.

:::warning
If you omit column and row coordinates for the child controls of a `Grid`, they will all be drawn in the top left 
corner (column=0, row=0).
:::

It is also possible to make a child control span more than one cell in either rows or columns, or both.

## Useful Properties

You will probably use these properties most often:

| Property               | Description                                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ColumnDefinitions      | Size definitions describing the widths of columns in the `Grid`.    |
| RowDefinitions         | Size definitions describing the heights of rows in the `Grid`.      |
| ShowGridLines          | Shows the gridlines between cells (as dashed lines).                |
| Grid.Column            | Lays out the control into the specified zero-based column.          |
| Grid.Row               | Lays out the control into the specified zero-based row.             |
| Grid.ColumnSpan        | Spans the control across 1 or more columns.                         |
| Grid.RowSpan           | Spans the control across 1 or more rows.                            |
| Grid.IsSharedSizeScope | Defines the control as the containing scope for a `SharedSizeGroup` |

## Size Definitions

You can define the size of rows and columns as:

* Absolute - sized in device-independent pixels (integer) 
* Proportional - sized in proportion to remaining `Grid` size
* Automatic - sized to fit the contained child control

Size definitions can be written either as a list of short codes, or fully expanded using XAML elements.

Full definitions support additional constraints such as `SharedSizeGroup` and specifying minimum and maximum lengths in 
absolute sizes.

### Absolute Size Definitions

Absolute size definitions are written as integers in the list format. For example:

`ColumnDefinitions="200, 200, 300"`

Using full expanded XAML, this is the same as:

```xml
<Grid>
   <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="200"></ColumnDefinition>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="200"></ColumnDefinition>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="300"></ColumnDefinition>
   </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
</Grid>
```

### Proportional Size Definitions

Proportional size definitions are written as proportions of available `Grid` space using an 
asterisk. For example, to create two columns with the same width and then one with twice the width:

`ColumnDefinitions="*, *, 2*"`

Using full expanded XAML, this is the same as:

```xml
<Grid>
   <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="*"></ColumnDefinition>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="*"></ColumnDefinition>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="2*"></ColumnDefinition>
   </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
</Grid>
```

:::tip
Size definitions do not support percentages. One trick to overcome this is to create a definition where all proportional 
values sum to 100 such as `<Grid ColumnDefinitions="25*, 25*, 50*">` for 3 columns with 25%, 25%, and 50% of the remaining 
available width.
:::

### Automatic Size Definitions

To size a row or column automatically to the largest child control in it, use the code 'Auto'.  For example:

`RowDefinitions="Auto, Auto, Auto"`

Using full expanded XAML, this is the same as:

```xml
<Grid>
   <Grid.RowDefinitions>
       <RowDefinition Height="Auto"></RowDefinition>
       <RowDefinition Height="Auto"></RowDefinition>
       <RowDefinition Height="Auto"></RowDefinition>
   </Grid.RowDefinitions>
</Grid>
```

:::warning
If a child control has its own explicitly set dimensions, these will be obeyed when it is drawn. This means that if it 
is larger than its grid cell, it will overlap adjacent cells.
:::

### Mixing Size Definitions

You can mix any of the above in the same size definition sequence. For example:

`ColumnDefinitions="200, *, 2*"`

Using full expanded XAML, this is the same as:

```xml
<Grid>
   <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="200"></ColumnDefinition>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="*"></ColumnDefinition>
       <ColumnDefinition Width="2*"></ColumnDefinition>
   </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
</Grid>
```

## Drawing Rules

When calculating sizes, any proportional columns are made to fit in the space left after the absolute and automatic values have been calculated.

The calculation for automatic sizing is made using the outside of the margin layout zone of a child control.

:::info
To review the concept of control layout zones, see [here](../../../concepts/layout/layout-zones). 
:::

Child controls are drawn in their assigned grid cells in the sequence they appear in the XAML. This rule governs both 
what happens when two child controls are assigned the same cell, and how child controls overlap when they are larger 
than their allotted cell.

When a child control has its own dimensions, and is smaller than its assigned cell, it will be drawn aligned in the 
cell according to its horizontal and vertical alignment properties (both are centered by default).

## Example

This example shows:

* How to use the shortened syntax for column and row definitions.
* How to mix absolute and proportional column widths.
* How to assign the cell for child controls.
* How to span rows and columns.

An example of a `Grid` with 3 equal Rows and 3 Columns with (1 fixed width), (2 grabbing the rest proportionally) would be:

```xml
<Grid ColumnDefinitions="100,1.5*,4*" RowDefinitions="Auto,Auto,Auto"  Margin="4">
  <TextBlock Text="Col0Row0:" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0"/>
  <TextBlock Text="Col0Row1:" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="0"/>
  <TextBlock Text="Col0Row2:" Grid.Row="2" Grid.Column="0"/>
  <CheckBox Content="Col2Row0" Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="2"/>
  <Button Content="SpansCol1-2Row1-2" Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1" Grid.RowSpan="2" Grid.ColumnSpan="2"/>
</Grid>
```

Here, after the absolute width of 100 has been subtracted (for column 0), column 1 will get 1.5 parts and column 2 will get 4 parts of the remaining width.

The button is drawn to fill the span from the cell (column 1, row 1) plus one column (to the right) and one row down. The result looks like this:
