# StorageProvider

The `StorageProvider` is central to file and folder management. It provides methods for file and folder selection, checking platform capabilities, and interacting with stored bookmarks.

The `StorageProvider` can be access through an instance of `TopLevel` or `Window`, for more details on accessing `TopLevel` please visit [TopLevel](../../toplevel) page:
```cs
var storage = window.StorageProvider;
```

```

### CanSave
Indicates whether it's possible to open a `save file picker` on the current platform.

```cs
bool CanSave { get; }
```

### CanPickFolder
Indicates whether it's possible to open a `folder picker` on the current platform.

\* Bookmarks are not properly supported on desktop platforms and instead return file path instead. macOS support is planned in order to get it work with Sandboxed Apple Store apps.

*** Only Chromium based browsers have a proper support for file pickers.
